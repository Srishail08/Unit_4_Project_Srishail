Players pass through Blue Portals to enter Ship Mode (flying physics) and Orange Portals to return to Cube Mode (jumping physics).
Collision detection for platforms, spikes, and buttons.
Calculates progress as a percentage and automatically saves the username and final score to a text file ScoreLog.txt upon game over or victory.
